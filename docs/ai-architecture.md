# AI Agent Architecture

## Agent Types
1. **Scheduler Agent**: Handles appointment scheduling logic
2. **User Agent**: Represents user preferences and requirements
3. **Provider Agent**: Manages provider availability and constraints
4. **Priority Agent**: Calculates appointment priorities using MCP

## Agent Communication Protocol
- WebSocket-based real-time communication
- Event-driven message passing
- Conflict resolution through negotiation

## Adaptive Data Kernel (ADK)
- Continuous learning from user behavior
- Pattern recognition and preference optimization
- Predictive scheduling suggestions

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Dynamic priority scoring
- Multi-factor priority assessment
- Real-time priority adjustments
